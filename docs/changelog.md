### Bug Fix
- Input file reading errors were not reported and crashdump output file did not

### New

- Performance enhancements for Uncore section were added. This controls via
`_max_time_sec` flag for PCI (30 seconds), MMIO (30 seconds) and RDIAMSR (30
seconds) records. If ACD takes more than the time mentioned by `_max_time_sec`
for a particular record, it will abort further collection of those record and
move ahead to other records. If such case is hit, `_<section_name>_aborted` key
will be inserted in the output file.
- Performance enhancement for big core section were added. This controls via
`_max_collection_sec` flag (default 15 seconds). If ACD takes more time than
mentioned by `_max_collection_sec`, it will abort further collection of big core
crash data and move ahead to other records. If such a case is hit,
`_big_core_aborted` key will be inserted in output file.
